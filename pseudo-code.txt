1. a method that returns the sum of two integers
Given two integers
Receive the two integers passed through the method
  - assign an addition operation to a new variable
  - end the method -> returning the result saved in the variable


2. a method that takes an array of strings, and returns a string that is all those strings concatenated together
Given a collection strings
Receive the collection passed through the method
  - iterate through the collection
  - assign each member of the collection to a variable
  - when all members of the collection have been added to the variable, end the iteration
  - end the method -> returning the result saved in the variable



3. a method that takes an array of integers, and returns a new array with every other element
Given a collection of integers
Receive the collection passed through the method
  - initialize a counter set to zero
  - initialize an empty array
  - iterate through collection
  - perform a test to determine if the counter has a remainder of 0 when divided by 2
    - if yes, add the current member of the collection to the empty array
  - add one to the counter before beginning the next iteration
  - after all iterations have finished, all the new array to be returned from the metho
